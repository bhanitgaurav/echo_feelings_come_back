## 🎯 Core Principle
Users should never feel like they are **“earning money”**.
They should feel like they are **being appreciated** for showing up, caring, and responding.

*   **Tone**: Warm, Emotional, Calm.
*   **Avoid**: Financial jargon (Wallet, Balance, Cash, Coins, Grind).
*   **Use**: Credits, Journey, Appreciation, Showing Up, Moments.

## 1️⃣ Credits (Mental Model)
*   **Label**: `Credits`
*   **Explanation**: “Credits are small rewards you receive for showing up, sharing kindness, and responding to others.”
*   **Secondary**: “They unlock expressions and special moments inside Echo.”

## 2️⃣ Wallet / History Screen
**Title**: `Your Credits`
**Subtitle**: “A record of moments where you were appreciated.”
*(Optional tiny text: "Some moments unlock credits.")*

| Transaction Type | Display Pattern | Subtext / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Referral** | "You invited a friend" | "Thanks for growing Echo with kindness." |
| **Seasonal** | "Valentine’s Appreciation" | (Metadata: "You replied to 5 echoes...") |
| **Streak** | "7-Day Kindness Streak" | "You shared kindness consistently." |
| **Log (0 Value)** | *Hidden* | (Use `visibility=INTERNAL` to hide) |

## 7️⃣ Explainability (Metadata)
Use the `metadata_json` field to show tooltips:
> "Why did I receive this?"
> "You replied to 5 echoes during Valentine’s Week."
> **Rule**: Explain Action → Context → Appreciation.

---

## 🧭 Language Rules
1.  **Prefer "Receive" > "Earn"**: "Receive" feels less transactional.
2.  **Prefer "Moment" > "Reward"**: Emotion over mechanics.
3.  **Hierarchy**: Appreciation > Meaning > Progress > Credits.
4.  **No Urgency**: Never use "Hurry", "Claim Now", or "Task Completed".

**Philosophy**: "Echo rewards you not for doing more—but for being present, kind, and responsive."
